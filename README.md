# Zenga - A Sega Master System emulator with a strange name

I grew up with 80s and 90s suggestions, in Italy.<br/><br/>
The biggest mediatic event of that era was the 1990 football world cup, that was taking place (obviously) in Italy. Despite the expectations, we finished third, and Walter Zenga was our great (or not so great) goalkeeper. Nonetheless, he used his popularity to become a testimonial for the Sega Master System console, and Megadrive/Genesis after that, filming some TV spots.<br/>
<br/>
So, which name is more appropriate for this emulator? No one.
<br/><br/>
I used javascript, of course. Javascript is so flexible and accessible that my only regret is to have written dream86 in Rust (damned Internet - x86 was totally feasible in javascript, and I bet it would have been faster than the Rust result).
<br/><br/>
Zenga was started because sometimes I feel the urge to code something, and because SMS is a nice old console.<br/>
Probably, the best thing about the 20 days that this coding streak lasted is the diary I wrote along the way, that translates into 10 articles on Medium, from the beginning of the project to a reasonable, temporary, ending.

For the rest, it is a nice little SMS emulator you can use everywhere (at home, at work... ops).
