# Zenga - A Sega Master System emulator with a strange name

I grew up with 80s and 90s suggestions, in Italy.<br/><br/>
The biggest mediatic event of that era was the 1990 football world cup, that was taking place (obviously) in Italy. Despite the expectations, we finished third, and **Walter Zenga** was our great (or not so great) goalkeeper. Nonetheless, he used his popularity to become a testimonial for the Sega Master System console, and Megadrive/Genesis after that, filming some TV spots.<br/>
<br/>
So, which name is more appropriate for this emulator? None.
<br/><br/>
I used javascript, of course. Javascript is so flexible and accessible that my only regret is to have written dream86 in Rust (damned Internet - x86 was totally feasible in javascript, and I bet it would have been faster than the Rust result).

<br/>
Zenga was started because sometimes I feel the urge to code something, and because SMS is a nice old console.<br/>
Probably, the best thing about the 20 days that this coding streak lasted is the diary I wrote along the way, that translates into 10 articles on Medium, from the beginning of the project to a reasonable, temporary, ending.<br/><br/>

Here are the 10 chapters:<br/><br/>

For the rest, it is a nice little SMS emulator you can use everywhere (at home, at work... ops).
